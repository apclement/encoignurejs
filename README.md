EncoignureJS is a web micro-framework that provides:

View container
----

Split your HTML page into multiple views managed by a view container.
The view container provides:
- Lazy downloading of views

Templating and data binding

EncoignureJS uses Weld for templating and WatchJS for live data binding solutions.
