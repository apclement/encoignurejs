Multiple views
----

Split your HTML into multiple manageable views. 
Provides the V (View) of the MVC pattern. 

Partial views
------

A view can be partial and only manages a subset of the page.


Animations
-----
Views are top down sized to have the height of their container (height: 100%). 
Therefore it is easy to animate transitions between two views.

Responsive composite views
------

Page responsive design is not restricted to the view content:
you can define composite views for larger screens from a set of views that are displayed alone on smaller screens
(with just a few lines of CSS).
